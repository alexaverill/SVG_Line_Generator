# SVG Line Generator
Being a bit annoyed at the idea of manually having to create SVG lines when trying to play around with a SVG background idea, and with no reasearch into other tools, 
I decided to have a go at getting a bit more knowledge of the Canvas Element as some pure JS.

The result will hopefully end up being a somewhat flexible SVG line generator that will output the nessisary SVG path info.
